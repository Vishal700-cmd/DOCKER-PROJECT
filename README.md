# DOCKER-PROJECT
This Project is related to Docker Compose and the file is in yml 
I do this Project on base OS REDHAT 8 or RHEL8 .
In RHEL8 configure the Docker after that pull the images from docker Hub.
After that I pull the two images from Docker Hub

Then code on yml but you write the code on yml install  Docker compose then you run the command "Docker-compose up -d" 
then go to the WebBrowser and start the project
